  <summary><b>Overview</b></summary>

### Overview
AtliQ manufactures computer hardware **products** (e.g., mouse, keyboard, printer, monitor) and then sells them to various **customers** which are stores such as Amazon and Best Buy. Hence, AtliQ's customers are in the form of <ins>store businesses</ins> (e.g., Amazon, Best Buy) and should not be confused with customers in the form of people (i.e., the people purchasing products from Amazon or Best Buy).

### Customers
AtliQ's customers are categorized into two different **platforms**:
1. Brick & Motar
   * stores that have physical location(s)
2. E-Commerce
   * stores which only sell products online

AtliQ's customers are categorized into three different **channels**:
1. Retailer
   * Stores not owned by AtliQ (e.g. Amazon, Best Buy)
3. Direct
   * Stores owned by AtliQ. These are AltiQ Exclusive and AtliQ E-Store.
5. Distributor
   * Some markets have laws/regulations which only allow AtliQ to sell products to a distributor type customer within that market. AtliQ sells products to the distributor; the distributor then sells the products to various stores within that market.

  <summary><b>Condensed Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement</b></summary>

### Condensed Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement
This example of a simplified P&L statement should give a better understanding of AtliQ's business model. In this example, the P&L calculations and values are derived from one sales transaction of one product being sold to one customer.
| Line Item | Description | P & L Value Formula | P&L Value Calculation | P & L Value |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | -: |
| Gross Price |  The base price of a product | not applicable | `not applicable` | `$50.00` |
| Pre-Invoice Deduction | For every fiscal year, the sales team determines a<br>pre-invoice deduction percentage for each<br><ins>specific customer</ins>. The pre-invoice deduction<br>percentage is based on AtliQ's relationship and<br>experience with the customer. The pre-invoice<br>deduction is applied to the gross price of the<br>product before it is billed to the customer. In this<br>example, the customer receives a pre-invoice<br>deduction of 10% of gross price. | (Gross Price $) *<br> (Pre&nbsp;Invoice&nbsp;Deduction&nbsp;%) | `$50.00` *<br>`0.10` | `$5.00` |
| Net Invoice Sales | The amount of money that is billed to the<br>customer to obtain the product, after<br>pre invoice deductions are subtracted<br>from gross price. | (Gross Price $) -<br>(Pre&nbsp;Invoice Deduction $) | `$50.00` -<br>`$5.00` | `$45.00` |
| Post-Invoice Deudctions | For&nbsp;each&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;month,&nbsp;the&nbsp;sales&nbsp;team<br>determines&nbsp;a&nbsp;post-invoice&nbsp;deduction&nbsp;percentage<br>based&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;<ins>specific&nbsp;customer&nbsp;and&nbsp;product</ins>.&nbsp;For<br>example,&nbsp;if&nbsp;AtliQ&nbsp;sells&nbsp;a&nbsp;product&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer<br>and&nbsp;that&nbsp;customer&nbsp;agrees&nbsp;to&nbsp;display&nbsp;the&nbsp;product&nbsp;at<br>a&nbsp;prime&nbsp;location&nbsp;within&nbsp;the&nbsp;store&nbsp;during&nbsp;a<br>specific&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;month,&nbsp;AtliQ&nbsp;may&nbsp;pay&nbsp;that<br>customer&nbsp;a&nbsp;post-invoice&nbsp;deduction.&nbsp;AtliQ&nbsp;pays&nbsp;a<br>post-invoice&nbsp;deduction&nbsp;amount&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rebate&nbsp;to&nbsp;the<br>customer&nbsp;after&nbsp;net&nbsp;invoice&nbsp;sales.&nbsp;In&nbsp;this&nbsp;example,<br>the&nbsp;customer&nbsp;receives&nbsp;a&nbsp;post-invoice&nbsp;deduction&nbsp;of<br>20%&nbsp;of&nbsp;net&nbsp;invoice&nbsp;sales. | not applicable | `$45.00` *<br>`0.20` | `$9.00` |
| Net Sales | AtliQ's Revenue | (Net Invoice Sales $) -<br>(Post-Invoice Deudctions $) | `$45.00` -<br>`$9.00` | `$36.00` |
| Cost of Goods Sold (COGS $) | Expenses AtliQ incurs such as manufacturing<br>products, shipping products, and storing products<br>in warehouses. | (Manufacturing Cost $) +<br>(Freight Cost $) +<br>(Other COGS $) | `not applicable` | `$16.00` |
| Gross Margin | AtliQ's Profit after deducing COGS from Net Sales. | (Net Sales $) -<br>(COGS $) | `$36.00` -<br>`$16.00` | `$20.00` |
| Operational Expenses | Expenses AtliQ incurs from activities such as<br>advertising and promotions of products<br>performed by the marketing team. | (Ads & Promotions $) +<br>(Other&nbsp;Operational&nbsp;Expense&nbsp;$) | `not applicable` | `$15.00` |
| Net Profit | AtliQ's Profit after deducting operational expenses<br>from gross margin. | (Gross Margin $) -<br>(Operational Expenses $) | `$20.00` -<br>`$15.00` | `$5.00` |
